## Greetings! 👾 I'm Haoran Shi, a Data Worker!!! 

### Who am I?
* 🎓 Finshed the data analytics with a Master's at **San Jose State Univeristy**. I turn data into decisions and insights into action.
* 🎓 Finshed the statistics specialize in data science with a Bachelor's at **Univeristy of California, Davis**. My journey with data starts here.
* 📈 From **Domino Data Lab** to **Walmart Global Lab** now at **Bytedance**'s strategic insights, I'm the maestro of data-driven stories.
* 🚀 Eyeing roles from **Late 2024** where I can orchestrate data into breakthrough business symphonies.
* 🏀 Baller by day, weightlifter by night. Off-court, I crunch numbers and pump iron with equal gusto.
